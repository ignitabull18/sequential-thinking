# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Requirements Analysis System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the AI-driven system for analyzing user requirements, generating clarifying questions, and preparing structured requirements for code generation.
# Details:
1. Implement integration with OpenAI GPT-4 API
2. Create prompt engineering for requirements analysis
3. Develop system for generating clarifying questions based on ambiguous requirements
4. Implement UI for displaying and answering clarifying questions
5. Create structured output format for requirements
6. Integrate semantic search of documentation to enhance requirements
7. Implement validation of requirements completeness
8. Add caching mechanism for API responses to reduce costs

# Test Strategy:
1. Test requirements extraction with various input formats
2. Verify clarifying questions are relevant and helpful
3. Test integration with semantic search
4. Validate structured output format
5. Test handling of edge cases and ambiguous inputs
6. Confirm caching mechanism works correctly
