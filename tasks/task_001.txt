# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with frontend and backend structure, and set up Supabase for authentication, database, and API key management.
# Details:
1. Create project repository with appropriate directory structure
2. Set up frontend with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI
3. Initialize backend with FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js)
4. Configure Supabase project with:
   - Authentication setup (email/password, OAuth)
   - Database tables: users, api_keys, documents (with vector column for pgvector)
   - Row Level Security policies for all tables
   - Storage buckets for documentation
5. Implement environment variable configuration
6. Create database schema with proper relationships and indexes
7. Set up pgvector extension in Supabase

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project structure follows best practices
2. Test Supabase connection and authentication flow
3. Confirm database tables are created with correct schemas
4. Validate RLS policies are working correctly
5. Ensure environment variables are properly loaded
