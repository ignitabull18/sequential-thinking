# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Documentation Analysis and Semantic Search
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for processing uploaded documentation, generating embeddings, and performing semantic search using pgvector.
# Details:
1. Implement document upload and storage in Supabase
2. Create text extraction from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
3. Integrate with OpenAI API to generate embeddings for document content
4. Store embeddings in the documents table using pgvector
5. Implement semantic search functionality using pgvector's similarity search
6. Create backend endpoints for document upload, processing, and search
7. Add document management UI for users to view and delete uploaded docs
8. Implement proper error handling for document processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Test document upload with various file formats
2. Verify text extraction accuracy
3. Test embedding generation and storage
4. Validate semantic search results for relevance
5. Confirm document management operations work correctly
6. Test error handling for invalid documents
